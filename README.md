A drawer is a user interface (UI) component that provides a hidden panel or container that can be accessed by sliding it into view from the edge of the screen. It is commonly used in web and mobile applications to display additional content, options, or navigation menus without completely obstructing the main content.

Here is a description of the various components :

1. Drawer Container(`.drawer`): The drawer container is the main container that holds all the elements of the drawer. It is usually a rectangular box positioned at the edge of the screen, such as the left or right side. It remains partially or completely hidden until triggered by user interaction. It has `.hide` class which hide the drawer from the users and once users click the button then they can able to see the drawer. Here i have developed that the drawer is opened from the left side.

2. Content Area(`.drawer-content`): The content area is the main section of the drawer where the actual content is displayed. It can contain various UI elements, such as text, images, links, buttons, or even nested components.

3. Close Button(`.close-navbtn`): The close button is a button located within the drawer that allows users to close or hide the drawer. It is typically represented by an "X" or a similar icon and placed at the top-right corner or in a prominent position for easy accessibility.

4. Overlay(`.drawer-backdrop`): When the drawer is open, an overlay is often applied to the rest of the screen to visually separate the drawer content from the underlying content. The overlay may be semi-transparent, dimming the background content, and preventing interaction with it while the drawer is open. Clicking outside the drawer or a designated close area typically closes the drawer.

5. Animation and Transition Effects: To provide a smooth and visually appealing experience, drawers often incorporate animation and transition effects when opening, closing, or switching between different states. This can include sliding, fading, or other types of motion effects.

Drawers offer a convenient way to present additional information or functionality in a compact and accessible manner.
